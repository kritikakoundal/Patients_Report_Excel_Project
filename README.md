### Cleaning Steps:
1. *Handling Missing Data*:
   - Columns like DEATHDATE, SUFFIX, MAIDEN, and ZIP have missing values.
   - Decide whether to impute, drop, or keep these missing values based on your analysis goals.

2. *Data Type Conversion*:
   - Convert BIRTHDATE and DEATHDATE to datetime.
   - Ensure ZIP is treated as a categorical or string data type if needed.

3. *Outlier Detection*:
   - Check for any outliers in LAT, LON, and other numerical fields,but it is not important.

4. *Standardization*:
   - Ensure consistency in categorical fields like GENDER, RACE, and ETHNICITY.

### Analysis Ideas:

- *Age Distribution*: Calculate and analyze the age distribution.
- *Mortality Analysis*: Compare living vs. deceased patients.
- *Geographical Analysis*: Explore location data (e.g., clustering, distribution by region).
